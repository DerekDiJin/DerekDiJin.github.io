Large scale graph mining, graph representation learning, social network analysis, summarization and applied machine learning


I research representation learning on large-scale graphs via deep learning and applied machine learning techniques. Specifically, my research topics are:

* ###### Scalable representation learning under various graph models such as the knowledge graph, heterogeneous graphs, temporal graphs, static homogeneous graphs, etc. ######


* ###### Graph summarization to reduce the complexity of the large-scale real-world graph data while retaining the computational power of models in machine learning tasks. ######

* ###### Domain-specific graph analysis and ######


My research applications include:

* ###### Web data entity linkage in knowledge integration and knowledge base construction, i.e., consolidate records from different web sources that represent the same real-world entity, such as the same book listed in different online sales websites.
%This application would significantly reduce the cost of future computation and storage. ######

* ###### Temporal link prediction and anomaly detection in heterogeneous web networks, e.g., predicting the potential friend of a user in social networks even though they didn't know about each other in the past, as well as detecting the fraud (such as a bot for malicious advertising) in user-product networks of the online sales website. This application aims to improve the quality of advertisement and customer purchasing experience. ######

* ###### Multi-modality representation fusion for recommendation \& customization, e.g., how to incorporate the multi-modal information of a book (such as the image of its cover and the textual description) to better represent it for classification or advertising to customers? ######
