About
------

Greetings! I'm a fifth-year Ph.D candidate in the Computer Science & Engineering department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests include large-scale graph mining, graph summarization, social network analysis, anomaly detection and applied machine learning. I'm a member of the GEMS Lab advised by Prof. Danai Koutra.

Before joining UM, Ann Arbor, I obtained my Master's degree in the Master of Computational Data Science program (MCDS) at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Prof. Christos Faloutsos.
