Greetings! I'm an applied scientist at Amazon Alexa. My research interests include large-scale graph mining, representation learning, transfer learning and applied machine learning.

Before joining UM, Ann Arbor, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science & Engineering department at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. Danai Koutra. I obtained my Master's degree in the Master of Computational Data Science program (MCDS) at the School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Prof. Christos Faloutsos.
